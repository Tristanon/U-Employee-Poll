## Description
- In this app, users are able to create and participate in polls, see which poll questions they have answered or not, see how other people have voted, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

- Once the user logs in, the user is able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created (top) to the least recently created (bottom).

- Upon voting in a poll, all of the information of an answered poll is displayed. The user’s response is recorded and clearly visible on the poll details page. Users can only vote once per poll; they are not allowed to change their answer after they’ve voted. When the user comes back to the home page, the polling question appears in the “Answered” column.

## Available Features
- User can see what poll is answered or unanswered.
- User can answer and create poll.
- User can see how many vote of the option they choose from the answered poll and percentage of people choosing that option.
- User can see the leaderboard where shows how many questions and answers each user has made and ranking of the most interactive user.
